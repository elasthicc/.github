Welcome to the [elasthicc](https://elasthi.cc) Open Source integrations organization.

## We love open source :computer:

Elasthicc would not be possible without the plethora of communities and open source projects freely available to anyone.
As a token of gratitude we are committed in releasing our internal packages for anyone else to use, under open source licenses.
We want to give a big shoutout to the [Pterodactyl](https://github.com/pterodactyl) community for their amazing work.

Below are our contributions:

- [pterodactyl-go](https://github.com/elasthicc/pterodactyl-go) —  A Go library for the Pterodactyl API.
- [midnight-kiss](https://github.com/elasthicc/midnight-kiss) —  Midnight kiss is a theme for the Pterodactyl Panel.

## Contribute :heart:

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Feel free to help us improve the documentation, report or fix bugs, propose new features!

###### :nail_care: If you are curious about our plans checkout [elasthi.cc](https://elasthi.cc)!
